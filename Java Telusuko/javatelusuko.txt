Installations:


Java installation:

JDK version opensource 
oracle JDK 21 LTS (Long Term Support) Download

check your enviorment variables and add path if not upto bin folder


IDE installation:

An IDE like VS Code, Eclipse, Intellij,e.t.c.
we use IDE here is VS Code

Extentions:


Kyewords:
cd: change directory in cmd
javac file name.java:compile the file
java class file name:execute the program to get output
System.out.print():print in same line
System.out.println():print and moves to next line

Coding:
sample code

first class name: class Main(classname){
    second method:public sstatic void main(String[]args){
        to print: System.out.println("hello world");
    }
}

Execution of our file in cmd or ide is to check error:

first compile the code using:javac Main.java 
file name if it is main.java we write this we need to write the .java extention while compiling
we get the class file if we compile the file if it has no errors like : main.class

second execute the class file to get output: java main (the class is created with name which we used in our program before)
if filename is test the classfile name looks like: test.class
